Google Cloud Platform Compute OS Configuration Policies
Google Cloud Platform has a handy capability to write yaml based files that allow inspection and/or enforcement of system states. I decided that this would be a handy way for a red team to remotely do things like have the target compute instance download files, run executables, install software, etc. like a system admin would. The only downside is that you need to tailor the GCP OS configuration policy script files specifically to the operating system version you are targeting which results in creating more OS policy files. As I experiement and create more OS policy files I will add them into this repo.
